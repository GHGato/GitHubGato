# GitHubGato
*GitHubGato is a new and innovated way to learn and play with coding commands on GitHub. GitHubGato incorporates a game like mechanic that engages users in learning and makes learning easier. Our team is inspired to improve the education curiculmn in programming through these innovative ways of learning that is user and beginner friendly, engaging, and encourages users to not only learn but to want to purse in this field of study.
# Inspiration
- GitHubGato's mascot, Gato, is inspired by NYU Hackathon's purple cat and GitHub's Octocat.
- The game mechanic added to learning is inspired our developers' love for games and Flexbox Froggie.
# How we built it
- Planning: GitHubGato started as a basic website design on Figma. There we picked our theme, colors, and fonts for the base of the website before building on top of it. We then planned the type of lessons to include in the game and how to implement those lessons.
- Development: Our developers worked on the coding and placement of the game to bring this program to life.
