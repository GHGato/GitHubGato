# GitHubGato
GitHubGato is a gaming program built for NYU Hackathon 2022 whose goal is to teach students how to use GitHub
# Inspiration
*GitHubGato's mascot, Gato, is a cat inspired by NYU Hackathon's purple cat and GitHub's mascot, the Octocat*
*The purple color was inspired by NYU's school color. A softer touch is added to the color to match the cute cat and appeal to students*
*This program is designed as a game*
# How we built it
*Planning: GitHubGato started as a basic website design on Figma. There we picked our theme, colors, and fonts for the base of the website before building on top of it. We then planned the type of lessons to include in the game and how to implement those lessons.
*Development: Our developers worked on the coding and placement of the game to bring this program to life.*
